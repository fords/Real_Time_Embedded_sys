# Real_Time_Embedded_sys

Presenting a general road map of real-time and embedded systems. The course is conducted in a studio class/lab format with lecture material interspersed with laboratory work. A family of microcontrollers are introduced that exemplify unique positive features as well as limitations of microcontrollers in the context of embedded and real-time systems. The microcontrollers are used as external, independent performance monitors of more complex real-time systems. The majority of the course presents material on a commercial real-time operating system (QNX) and applies it to programming projects on development systems as well as embedded target systems. Fundamental material on real-time operating systems and multiprocessor considerations for real-time systems are also presented. Examples include scheduling algorithms, priority inversion, and hardware-software co-design. </br>
